# Hackuarium_oFoldscope
repo for open old-school ofoldscope information and use, to make a microscope all in laser-cut paper, except the ball lens in glass.

Foldscope templates used to date (thank you OB, wherever you may be!), and further info, including our first images can be found in this google drive folder. [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1jaPHOkH_42ei16MmxZbEZHb1E].
The Hackuarium wiki page [https://wiki.hackuarium.ch/w/Foldscope] has more information.
